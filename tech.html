            <h3 id="autonomous-vehicles">Autonomous Vehicles (AV)</h3>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles (AV) also referred to as driverless cars, are able to sense the surrounding environment and navigate safely with little to no human intervention. They rely on sensors, complex algorithms, actuators (component of a machine that is responsible for movement and control of the car), powerful processors and machine learning systems. These cars are able to be in full control with or without a human passenger.</p>
            <p>These cars contain a variety of sensors located throughout the different parts of the vehicle. This includes video cameras to detect traffic lights, track other vehicles, understand road signs and most importantly, look out for pedestrians. They utilise radar sensors to monitor nearby vehicles. Lidar sensors (light detection and ranging sensors) indicates and measures distance, detect road edges and lane markings by bouncing light off the car’s surroundings. The detection of curbs and other cars when parking occur via the ultrasonic sensors inside of the wheels.</p>
            <p>Advanced software then processes all of the sensory input, plots a journey, and sends the instructions to the actuators which controls steering, braking and acceleration. The car then follows traffic rules and navigates obstacles through an intricate set of hard-coded rules, predictive modelling, object recognition and obstacle avoidance algorithms.</p>
            <p>Though some may be intrigued and excited about owning a fully autonomous car, several countries are still testing the reliability and safety of them. Some of the top challenges seem to be environmental, philosophical and legislative.  So, they won’t be available to the general public for a number of years yet.</p>
            <p>Some of the unknowns include, weather conditions such as heavy rains and snow and the effects on camera visibility and reliability of the sensors to track lane markings. Potential issues regarding the expense of Lidar, and will other autonomous cars travelling on the same road interfere with the lidar signals.  Will travelling through tunnels and over bridges be an issue?  What about bumper to bumper traffic?  Can the autonomous car regulate correctly?  Then there is the question around accident liability, who is at fault? The manufacturer? The human passenger? Another concern is the difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence when it comes to the subtle cues and life-saving instincts that humans may have over a machine.</p>
            <p>As of 2021, there are no companies that offer a fully autonomous car to the public. There are companies introducing very limited technologies for public accessibility such as sophisticated cruise control systems, and then there are companies that have managed to introduce almost autonomous technology, but under extremely restricted circumstances, such as shuttle buses on college campuses.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Some of the big car companies have disputed some of the technology that makes up the autonomous vehicle such as the lidar sensors, but technology that is not in dispute is machine learning and AI. Most companies have constructed a simulation environment – a virtual city as it were – to run their cars through and quickly test rare scenarios or hardware tweaks. Think of it as Tron meets calculus homework. Any company who has built such a simulation has invariably run many more “miles” inside the virtual world than in the real one. What enables these simulations to be so valuable is incredibly detailed mapping of intersections, routes, and even whole cities. (Kaslikowski 2019)</p>
            <p>There are different levels of autonomous vehicles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Level 1 since 1950, provides computer assistance for simple driver functions e.g. ABS, cruise control, Stability Control).
            </li>
              <br>
              <li>Level 2 since 2000, provides partial automation of one feature at a time e.g. automatic emergency breaking AEB.
            </li>
              <br>
               <li>Level 3 available now, provides two or more simultaneous functions e.g. cruise control and lane keeping.
            </li>
              <br>
              <li>Level 4 is in testing and will result in most driving functions being automated with the need for human intervention only in unusual circumstances. This automation will allow drivers to read and relax during their journeys.
            </li>
              <br>
              <li>Level 5 from 2060+ and will be fully autonomous. All driving functions will be fully computer controlled with absolutely no human intervention. Not even a steering wheel. The driver could sleep during their journey.
            </li>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">The scenarios for convenience and quality-of-life improvements are limitless. The elderly and the physically disabled would have independence. If your kids were at summer camp and forgot their bathing suits and toothbrushes, the car could bring them the missing items. You could even send your dog to a veterinary appointment. But the real promise of autonomous cars is the potential for dramatically lowering CO2 emissions. (Synopsys 2019)</p>
            <p>The Three Revolutions in Urban Transportation study produced by the University of California, Davis, and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, concluded that if society adopts electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and ride sharing concurrently by 2050, this could lower the CO2 from 4,600 megatonnes to 500 megatonnes per year. That’s an 80% cut in emissions worldwide.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that the introduction of fully autonomous vehicles will have a major economic impact and affect many industries, not just the automotive industry. The following industries are set to be impacted one way or another; Personal travel, Public sector, Real Estate, Energy suppliers, Healthcare, Freight, Insurance, Telecommunications, just to name a few. Within each of the mentioned industries, there is a wide range of jobs that may prosper and some that will decline or cease completely. That means potentially high unemployment rates but also the opportunities for upskilling to keep up with the inevitable changes coming our way in the technology sectors. Some obvious contenders of being made redundant by autonomous cars are independent taxi services, Lyft and Uber drivers even regional flights may become a less favoured option due to the availability of hiring or buying an AV to drive you without the hassle of parking, checking in, security etc.</p>
           <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Just like the computer, and the car before that, autonomous vehicles will send substantial and numerous shock waves through the world economy. You would be hard pressed to find an industry that will not be impacted (for good or for bad) by autonomous vehicles. Importantly, the economic impacts of the autonomous car will be magnified and accelerated by two parallel innovations: the electric car and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS). Each of these technologies is important and significant on its own. But together these technologies create a virtuous cycle the will expand their respective impact far beyond anything that would be achieved on their own. (Economic Impact 2018). </p>
            <p>Personally, having access to a fully autonomous car would be life-changing. The convenience of being driven through peak-hour traffic and only having to focus on finishing my book or study, would result in a stress-free journey. I will save time as there will be no need to worry about finding a car park. The option of being driven interstate to see my family, subject to available infrastructure, instead of getting on a plane, with the ability to sleep all the way there, would be brilliant. These types of cars would help my elderly family members and friends and eventually myself, to keep our independence in our aging years.</p>
            <p>Having said all that, I wouldn’t use an autonomous car until they had been cleared as 100% reliable and safe. With so much computerisation involved, they are susceptible to hacking and malfunction. If I had the choice between a Level 5, fully automated with no access to a steering wheel and a Level 4, most functions automated except under unusual circumstances, I would choose Level 4, as I don’t completely trust the way the world is heading in relation to the advancements in technology. I feel like it is about to supersede the need for humans in every sector. Sometimes it’s important to stop and look around at what we’ve got before it’s gone forever.</p>

<h1 id="NLP">Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots</h1>
</p>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence
  which allows computers to break down, decipher and make sense of the human
  language in a way that is useful in tasks such as making appointments,
  spell checking, generating responses and social media monitoring. NLP is
  the power behind such applications as Google Translate, Microsoft Word, OK
  Google, Siri, Alexa, and Cortana. NLP is used in email filters, data and
  text analysis, predictive text and digital phone calls.
</p>
<p>
  Natural Language Processing is the language that allows chatbots to
  understand your messages and respond, it provides the intent, context and
  meaning to text-based user inputs so that AI can come up with the best
  response. An NLP chatbot can give the users a feeling that they are having
  a conversation rather than going through a limited set of options and menus
  to reach their end goal.
</p>
<p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
  ‘NLP is widely implemented to chat with customers and listen to
  conversations to understand sentiments, topics of interest, answer
  questions, and filter fake and toxic content.’ (Dataversity 2021)
</p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
</p>
<p>
  With advances in Deep Learning and higher computer capabilities NLP
  technology has been progressing so rapidly that data scientists have had to
  continually learn new machine learning techniques to keep up, but since the
  development of the current NLP architecture - attention based networks -
  data scientists will finally have that time to catch up.
</p>
<p>
  Attention based networks started to become popular from 2015 onwards.
  Attention based networks are a type of neural network that allows the focus
  to be on a specific subset of data input, specifically what you want the
  network to pay attention to. From 2017 a specific type of attention based
  network called The Transformer Model has been especially dominant in modern
  NLP architecture. An example of a Transformer Model is BERT, a machine
  learning model developed by Google in 2018.
</p>
<p>
  BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a
  machine learning framework designed to help computers understand the
  meaning of vague and confusing language in text by using the surrounding
  text to establish context. The BERT framework was pre-trained using text
  from Wikipedia and can be fine-tuned with question-and-answer datasets.
</p>
<p>
  One of the focuses of NLP in the next few years will be on customer
  service, specifically with the integration of virtual customer assistants
  or chatbot technology. It is estimated that a quarter of customer service
  jobs will be moved over to this technology in 2020.
</p>
<p>
  The current global health crisis has accelerated customer adoption of
  touchless AI systems like voice assistants.
</p>
<p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
  “More than three-quarters of customers (77%) expect to increase the use
  of touchless interfaces to avoid direct interactions with humans or
  touchscreens during COVID-19, and 62% will continue to do so
  post-COVID”.
  - (IT Pro 2020)
</p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
</p>
<p>
  NLP is a powerful tool for productivity. It will allow us to work smarter
  and faster with fewer mistakes. Chatbots used for customer service and in
  financial institutions allow customers to get immediate answers to their
  questions no matter the time of day or day of the week. Due to advances in
  machine learning techniques, chatbots can even detect a user’s intention.
  It can provide instant links to instructions and give predefined answers to
  a customer’s questions. It can handle mundane and routine tasks such as
  repetitive questions, moderating comments and classifying emails, which
  will improve user satisfaction. Chatbots can respond to billions of demands
  at the same time making these processes faster and more cost efficient.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since the industrial revolution, there has been an underlying fear
  about machines taking jobs away from humans. Many people still like the
  human interaction that comes with face to face contact and conversation
  with humans.
</p>
<p>
  Chatbots are impersonal and lack human warmth. How long will it be before
  you never get to talk to a human voice at the end of a telephone. Jobs
  using speech are at the most risk of being made redundant with these new
  technologies.
</p>
<p>
  Will Google Translate eventually replace translators? Will Siri and Alexa
  replace workplace assistants? Or will they just be of added benefit? The
  future is here, and it is a bit scary but will certainly be efficient.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Today I used ‘Hey Siri’ for the first time on my iPhone. It wasn’t a huge
  learning curve; I just went into the settings and activated the ‘Listen for
  Hey Siri’. I’ve been playing around with it today. ‘Hey Siri, play
  Paperback Writer’.
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>Ding Ding. Here’s Paperback Writer by The Beatles
  </em>. There it was.
  Brilliant. ‘Hey Siri. Play Pauline Vs Margaret’.
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>Ding Ding. Here’s Naked by Ella Mai
  </em>. The actual song title is
  Margaret Vs Pauline, so it was a bit hit and miss on deciphering the intent
  of my request and possibly also my accent and tone but was still brilliant.
</p>
<p>
  In writing this report on natural language processing I have been using
  Microsoft Word’s rewrite suggestions option.
</p>
<p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
  Susan Hendrich, Microsoft’s group program manager of AI and NLP for
  Office, told VentureBeat that Rewrite Suggestions uses a
  Transformer-based model, and that all new features were developed in
  conjunction with Microsoft Research.
  - (VentureBeat 2020)
</p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
</p>
<p>
  In researching this report, I googled ‘natural language processing for the
  elderly’ and one of the results was a paper exploring the use of natural
  language processing to predict loneliness in older community dwelling
  adults. Another article talked about speech analysis detecting early
  linguistic signs of cognitive decline in a population of elderly
  individuals. Could Siri or a counterpart of Siri read the local newspaper
  to my elderly parents and other friends or family members? Could I
  eventually have a natural language processing Assistant who will write a
  book with me or play accompaniment on an instrument or harmonise when I’m
  singing Paperback Writer? The possibilities seem endless.

<h1 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning (ML)</h1>
          <p>
            The concept of machine learning (ML) is often confused with artificial intelligence. In fact, machine learning could be described as a subset of AI.
            The term machine learning first appeared in 1952 by an IBM computer scientist Arthur Samuel (Keith 2019). Machine learning could simply be explained as a technology of teaching and training a machine with an algorithm to perform a specific task.
            Generally, it could be categorised into three strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most introduced model is called supervised learning. It could also be described as a task-driven learning because it focuses on solving a specific task.
            The learning module gets a certain labelled data input to interpret and make predictions for a new set of input based on the given data.
            Later, the precision will improve by returning feedback for the output (Heidenreich 2018).
            This method is commonly used in software such as weather forecasting and image classification where we can find abundant training data and produce categorical predictions (Yagcioglu 2020).
          </p>
          <p>In contrast to a task-driven model, a data-driven model is also implemented in various applications. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm will be given unlabelled data, so that the algorithm itself can find meaningful patterns from it just like human intelligence.
            Thus, they can independently group, sort, and cluster the data to produce certain outcomes. Unsupervised learning can be found in areas with a great amount of unlabelled data, for example marketing and recommendation systems.
            Therefore, this model is commonly used in recommendation systems and clustering data segments (Heidenreich 2018).
          </p>
          <p>
          Lastly, reinforcement learning takes a different approach from the two methods above. It could be described as a trial-and-error based learning algorithm. Avoiding too much detail, reinforcement learning must consist of two elements called the environment and the agent. It is basically a loop where the agent performs an action to the environment, and it returns feedback about the state and any corresponding rewards. Thus, the algorithm itself improves the precision of the action in a given state (Moni R 2019). This technology is often applied in games, robotic simulations, and resource management (Heidenreich 2018).
          </p>
          <p>
          Besides the technical aspects of machine learning, there are other technologies that assist to build machine learning projects. Most of those technologies are an open-source library for creating algorithms to use for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Keras and Tensorflow could be said to be the most widely used libraries when it comes to machine learning projects. Especially, Tensorflow, created by Google, is widely used by several major industries such as eBay, Dropbox, and Intel (The 6 most important technologies in machine learning 2019).
          </p>
          <p>
          The rapidness of development in the machine learning field creates difficulties in figuring out the current stage of development. Not only the enhancement of the learning algorithm, but the implementation of machine learning seems to happen everywhere. A recent overflow of data from so many industries enabled machine learning to be implemented in modern technology using real-time decision making. For instance, trained computer vision and real-time decision making are now an essential feature of autonomous vehicle technology and military machinery (Baker 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            The senior director and the leader of Advanced Analytics Lab at SAS, Jin-Whan Jung, has summarised some of the main streams of machine learning for the near future. He suggested that a combination of machine learning and internet of things (IoT) will transform the shape of industries. He expects that the efficiency and productivity of machine learning will be significant. However, he pointed out that better adaptability will be an important challenge for machine learning prior to wider implementation because diverse business areas will require different techniques. Furthermore, he projected that ethical rights and justifications of using machine learning and AI will be a major concern in the future (Baker 2021).

          Machine learning technology has already been implemented across a wide variety of industrial sectors.
          In the past, machine learning was only used by an industry with big data for analytical purposes. Later upgrades in productivity, widened the application of machine learning from personalised advertisements to patient care and the potential is immeasurable.

          Some research reflects the benefits of machine learning in industries. Research conducted by Mckinsey analytics in 2018 provided insight into cases of machine learning use. One of the major uses of machine learning is automatised maintenance. It can be used to make predictions and decisions based on the recorded data and additional observable data like imagery and audio. Furthermore, data optimisation could be extended to live behavioural feedback. Since a machine learning algorithm is capable of constant interpretation and decision making, the ideal actions could take place correspondingly at the right time. Even with a very minor advancement in efficiency, the expected outcomes will be significant for the company.  (Mckinsey&Company, 2018, p.7 ~ p.8)

            A vast majority of the worldwide population, who have access to the internet and mobile devices, would have already experienced machine learning in many ways, but it is often hard to realise it. Meanwhile, the social impact of machine learning could be significant for workers in some industries Some critiques argue that artificial intelligence as well as machine learning could cause serious job loss and unemployment issues.

            In 2019, Amazon announced a $700 million investment in higher skills training for employees by 2025. Many training programs are including IT technologies and machine learning courses. Thereby, major industries like Amazon are already preparing for the next industrial evolution (Amazon 2019).  Therefore, the automation of jobs might be inevitable. However, it is also hoped that it will result in a better quality of life and higher value of human beings.

            Machine learning and its capabilities could be a fantastic opportunity for myself. If I can adequately understand the concept of machine learning and appropriately implement the technology, a career as a machine learning developer seems optimistic. Nevertheless, as I have explained earlier, the rapidness of development in machine learning would be a big challenge for any professional in this field.

            Machine learning and my daily life are closely related. Just like many others, YouTube is one of my most important applications when it comes to my daily routine whether it is for study purposes or for entertainment. My video preferences and recommendations are predicted by a trained algorithm using machine learning technology. They examine my watch history, subscribed channels, and other personal profiles to predict my video preference and personalise my video feed and recommendation list. Despite that this is clearly aimed at a better user experience, it often raises concerns about providing too much personal information, thus the company and their machines might already be able to predict who I am as a person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Machine learning will be fundamental to most IT technologies that are expected to become feasible soon, specifically technologies regarding to artificial intelligence and automation such as autonomous vehicles and virtual assistants. Yet the dark side of IT, especially when it comes to collecting personal data, will always follow every machine learning development because of the importance of personal data in algorithm training. Thus, finding a better way of securing myself and my family’s private information would be the next question that needs to be answered.

            <p>

            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; font-style: italic;">

            Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. It also refers to the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security may also be referred to as information technology security. (GROOT, 2020)</p>
            <p>Cybersecurity risk is increasing, driven by global connectivity and usage of cloud services, like Amazon Web Services, to store sensitive data and personal information. Widespread poor configuration of cloud services paired with increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals means the risk that your organization suffers from a successful cyber-attack or data breach is on the rise</p>
            <p>Gone are the days of simple firewalls and antivirus software being your sole security measures. Business leaders can no longer leave information security to cybersecurity professionals.
            </p>
            <p>Cyber threats can come from any level of your organization. You must educate your staff about simple social engineering scams like phishing and more sophisticated cybersecurity attacks like ransomware attacks (think WannaCry) or other malware designed to steal intellectual property or personal data. </p>
            <p>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; font-style: italic;">
            A lack of focus on cybersecurity can damage your business in range of ways including:<br>
            <br>
            Economic costs: Theft of intellectual property, corporate information, disruption in trading and the cost of repairing damaged systems.<br><br>
            Reputational costs: Loss of consumer trust, loss of current and future customers to competitors and poor media coverage<br><br>
            Regulatory costs: GDPR and other data breach laws mean that your organization could suffer from regulatory fines or sanctions because of cybercrimes.<br><br>
            All businesses, regardless of the size, must ensure all staff understand cybersecurity threats and how to mitigate them. This should include regular training and a framework to work with to that aims to reduce the risk of data leaks or data breaches. (Tunngal, 2021)<br></p>


             
            <p>
            Given the nature of cybercrime and how difficult it can be to detect, it is difficult to understand the direct and indirect costs of many security breaches. This does not mean the reputational damage of even a small data breach or other security event is not large. If anything, consumers expect increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity measures as time goes on. </p>
            <p>
            Currently it is affecting me in my workplace our company (Hospitals) IT system currently experiencing cyber-attack thus disabling us to help and serve people with their surgical procedures, even how careful and thorough our IT staff are we still been attacked. It really is unpredictable the world of cyber security is evolving every day, and cyber-criminals are trying to take advantage of it to gain as much money and power as possible. As the Internet continues to grow, more people around the world join the Internet. The purpose of this is to see how much of an importance cyber security has and how cyber-criminals are able to utilize the cyberworld for their own personal gain. Research has been done on how the cyberworld got where it is today. Additionally, individual research has been done to learn how to hack. A hack lab has been created and a study has been done to see if it is possible to hack into a cell phone within one month without obtaining any knowledge prior to the start of the study.</p>
            <p>
            With my experience as of 2021 modern day technology information theft is the most expensive and fastest growing segment of cybercrime. Largely driven by the increasing exposure of identity information to the web via cloud services. But it is not the only target. Industrial controls that manage power grids and other infrastructure can be disrupted or destroyed. And identity theft is not the only goal, cyber-attacks may aim to compromise data integrity (destroy or change data) to breed distrust in an organisation or government. The number of cyber-attacks and data breaches in the recent years is staggering and it's easy to produce a laundry list of companies who are household names that have been affected.</p>
            <p>
            Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated, changing what they target, how they affect organizations and their methods of attack for different security systems. Social engineering remains the easiest form of cyber-attack with ransomware, phishing, and spyware being the easiest form of entry. Third-party and fourth-party vendors who process your data and have poor cybersecurity practices are another common attack vector, making vendor risk management and third-party risk management more important.</p>
