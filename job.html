            <h3>Differences in Ideal Jobs</h3>

               <center><img src="img/ideal1.gif" alt="AV" width="550" height="400"></center>

               <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">We have differentiated each of our group ideal jobs in IT into (3) three similarly common jobs. (Based on Top Burning Glass Occupations)</p>

            <p><b>1.Programmers</b></p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Computer programmers are the brains behind software functions they write 	and test the code that makes up software programs. Not just from simple computer games or word processors all the way up to complicated operating systems and database management systems.</p>

            <p><b>2.Technical Support</b></p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Tech Support typically handles both hardware and software issues at the user level, helping the less tech-savvy with their computer problems making communication skills, problem solving, and well-rounded tech knowledge an asset. </p>

            <p><b>3.Computer System Analyst</b></p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Computer systems analyst experts are the multitaskers of information technology. They must understand computer hardware, software, and networks and how they all come to work together. Their job requires a multitude of different skills, including the ability to analyse information quickly and effectively, excellent communication, and the ability to persuade when necessary.</p>

               <center><img src="img/ideal2.gif" alt="CP1" width="960" height="645"></center>
               <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">It is important to be aware of the different career paths that are available in the IT industry to have a complete understanding of the roles and required skill for our ideal jobs. Each career path has a specific set of required skills and personality traits. Almost every IT job depends on strong technical knowledge. Having said that, each has a different emphasis, whether the job centres on coding, managing hardware, applying software, data science or managing systems or people.</p>
               <p style="font-family: 'Avenir';font-weight: 50;">Our career plans align on many roles in the information technology sector.

                     <h1><strong>Team Project OTOD Tech Interview questions </strong></h1>

                      <p>Interviewers: Peter Aird and Jaejun Oh</p>

                      <p>Interviewee: Reuben Korngold</p>

                      <p><strong>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong></p>

                      <p>Reuben is an IT consultant, and he works for a company called Access HQ (Human quality). They help organisations improve the quality of their IT services for other companies.</p>

                      <p><strong>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</p></strong>
                      
                      <p>As an IT consultant, Reuben interacts with a wide variety of people, a lot of IT professionals in his own company and IT professionals in other companies, and clients who have no expertise in IT at all. But the person most essential that he interacts with is the end-user (general public.) of the IT programs his company helps other companies to develop. They are at the core of everything his company does.</p>

                      <p><strong>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </strong></p>

                      <p>He spends a lot of time talking/communicating with others, selling his services to other companies, and putting together proposals. The proposals can be quite complex and take a lot of time for himself and his team to do, but they can lead to a lot of money for his company at the end of the day.</p>

                      <p><strong>What aspect of their position is most challenging? </strong></p>

                      <p>Reuben fines that time management and his team's coordination is the most challenging part of his job. IT is not always a 9 to 5 job. Sometimes you have deadlines you have to meet or bugs that need fixing. All of which can be time-critical. While making sure you keep downtime for yourself to manage your headspace, keeping yourself balanced and productive.</p>
                      
                      <p>These are the Interview questions with&nbsp;a brief summary&nbsp;of Reuben Korngold&rsquo;s answers please see the transcript for more details.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p><strong>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

                      <p>I had many different roles over the years, from software development, systems administration, software testing, project and portfolio management. These days, I&nbsp;works&nbsp;for a company called Access HQ as an IT consultant.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p><strong>Please tell us about the industry you work in.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>The organisation I work for helps other companies deliver high-quality large IT projects. My time is spent in a sales capacity, talking to different companies about what my company can help them improve on. We deal with a lot of various industries, everything from supply chains to Foxtel.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p><strong>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</strong></p>

                      <p>We also look at how our clients do business and work with them to set strategies and approaches that will allow them to focus on a quality outcome for their business and their end-user. We do this by running workshops bringing people together and building a shared understanding, concentrating on solving any problems that may arise.</p>

                      <p><strong>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</strong></p>

                      <p>I deal with many different people with different personalities, and one of the main ways we interact is through our program called Gantt. It helps keep everyone on track and organised. Some of the other roles we might deal with are procurement officers, selling consultants, solution architects, development managers, testing managers and various other people.</p>

                      <p><strong>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</strong></p>

                      <p>In the IT industry, you get some unique personalities. You have to sometimes negotiate with them and have the right conversations, particularly where we're focusing on quality. These can be tough conversations, especially when they feel they finished the job, but it doesn't meet the quality standards required, and that's a conversation you'll have to have with them. We work in a technical sphere, and there's a balance, knowing that a person doing a perfect job and getting it right within the constraints, importantly aligning to what customers want. Just because you built something brilliant doesn't mean it's what they wanted. Quality is so important in IT projects. Why? Because a lot of IT projects fail. And why do they fail because of lack of understanding and lack of proper management.</p>

                      <p><strong>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</strong></p>

                      <p>We have lots of different clients from pizza companies to governments. If you all consider the pizza companies, there's many of them, Pizza Hut, Domino's and others. They're all competing for your pizza dollars on a Friday night. And if The Pizza Hut websites down and the customer buys a Domino's Pizza instead, then Pizza Hut risk that customer not coming back. They may have enjoyed the Domino's Pizza, and next time, they'll buy a Domino's pizza instead. They know their website works anyway. It's also essential to manage the expectations of our clients. Some of them want unicorns at the lowest price possible and wanting everything done within the week when it actually would take a couple of months. Other clients are happy with a quality product within a reasonable budget.</p>

                      <p><strong>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</strong></p>

                      <p>I spend a lot of time talking and communicating with others, using tools like Microsoft teams, selling services to other companies, and putting together proposals. The proposals can be pretty complex, like a University assignment. They can have word limits and need diagrams. It can take a lot of time to do, and where time allows, it's essential to be consistent. The client should never know that more than one person has worked on the document. Especially considering it's representing the company and can make a lot of money.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p><strong>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>Every project and every client&nbsp;is&nbsp;different, so we always&nbsp;have to&nbsp;adapt. Sometimes you know the challenges can be Impossible. Sometimes the right thing to do is to say no. and help manage people's expectations. Tell them you need six months to do this. But all we have is six weeks.&nbsp;So&nbsp;let's see what we can do to improve. It's better to say no to the business, than take on bad business. Time management can also be challenging. IT projects rarely are a nine to five job, especially If you want to be successful. If you're building software and needs to be built by Friday, time is very important, things can run smoothly, and other times you have extra debugging to fix. It's necessary to be in the right headspace to do productive work, so it's keeping that balance and making sure to take some downtime for yourself to help you recharge.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p><strong>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>I've got two for you,&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>The first one, Y2K.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>From about 1950, software was designed to run on computers that had limited memory. To save space, they decided to use two digits for the year. Instead of 1990, they used. 90. It wasn't a problem until they started going from 31 December 99 to 1 January 00. It was a problem, especially on and calculating interest. So, we had about four years to fix the Y2K bug. There was a lot of work right across the world. I was involved in helping with repairs, and afterwards, people who weren't in IT said it was all false. Nothing broke, without realizing that people had spent years fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>The second involved Game of Thrones and Foxtel.</p>

                      <p>We got a call about six weeks before the last episode of Game of Thrones, and they asked if their system was going to perform. This was one of the jobs where we needed six months, not six weeks. They were expecting around 600,000 people to stream the episode simultaneously. It's never been done in Australia before, and many people told us we couldn't do it, but we did it anyway. I had to force it through. We're working with the Chief Operating Officer of Foxtel, who said Reuben, you tell me anybody who tells you no, and I don't care who they are. I'll make sure that they changed their answer to yes, so we had to work with many different companies. We looked at the whole thing end to end. When you log in, to the thumbnails images, there are all kinds of marketing systems at work. We learned that it doesn't just download the movie when you press play on one of those thumbnails. It streams it in tiny packets. It happens dynamically depending on your bandwidth, system, thousands of different things. We ended up testing about one terabit per second of traffic across the Internet. We got a warning letter from Amazon Web Services saying you were generating too much traffic. Telstra said no, they didn't want us to do it. The people from Foxtel said, you better do it, or we'll go sign up with Optus instead. There was a heap of different things that ended up happening. We tested the system five times, close to a million concurrent video streams, and the first test didn't work. We found a problem.&nbsp;This is why&nbsp;you test things repeatedly because you try it out, and things don't work. We made some fixes, and we tested it again and again. Until we got it right. If we hadn't have done all that work, Foxtel probably would have ended up with many unhappy customers getting upset in a world of pain because they couldn't watch their favourite TV show. They may have asked, why am I paying this company so much money for a subscription when I can't even use it. Ultimately it would mean people would have left them. They would have lost money. Instead, they had one of the best days of business they ever had, and instead of bad publicity, it was all good for them.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p><strong>Bonus question: Whats the one program you could recommend us to learn that will help us get into the IT industry and that&rsquo;s in high demand?&nbsp;</strong></p>

                      <p>I think technical skills are important, but technical skills alone it is not enough either. It's also really about attitude.So I would say at least two things technical skills and the right attitude. And the reason I say that is if you only know how to do one thing. You will struggle in the IT industry. But at least if you know multiple programming languages, you're adept at changing to a third one. So pretty much saying it's not about being able to perform any specific technology, but rather learning and adapting to a new one. When I was at Uni, I learned C and Pascal and COBOL as well. Now COBOL is still around in places like banks, government agencies, any slow-moving organisations. It's getting less and less. But again, if you're a COBOL programmer and you didn't move with the times, then you would probably be struggling for work right now. Every few years, there is always something new to learn. That's why a learning mindset is so important. It's much easier to adapt to the next greatest thing that comes along.&nbsp;</p>

              <p> <b>Team reflection</b> 

                      <p> Overall, the interview was an informative, fun conversation full of interesting, enlightening stories. Given a chance, the whole team could've sat down and had a cup of coffee and chatted to Reuben for hours, picking his brain. When we reflect on what we learnt from the interview, it's that the IT industry is a unique industry with its own set of challenges, moral dilemmas and problems. Still, at the heart of it, IT is no different to any other industry. The jobs and problems might be different, and whether you are racing to meet a sales deadline or a coding deadline, at the end of the day, it's all the same, people interacting with people, trying to overcome problems and achieving a shared goal. To quote Reuben, "technical skills are important, but technical skills alone is not enough either. It's also really about attitude."</p>
