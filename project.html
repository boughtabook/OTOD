            <p>According to the graph below and growth projections, plus factoring in Covid-19, rideshare businesses are on the rise, and by 2026 expected to grow by 27%, so we wanted to create an app that is a little different and has a competitive edge...</p>

             <p>Introducing myCarPal.</p>
            <p>myCarPal is a mobile rideshare application and is here to help make travel social, accessible and available to everyone, while sharing the cost.</p>
            <p>Imagine an app you can log into and find other users who want to travel to the same destination as you - whether it is a regular commute into your local business centre for work or a one-off day trip down the coast to visit family or friends. The myCarPal app is a cost efficient, user friendly app which will be offered on both the Android and IOS operating systems.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of ride sharing apps out there but none that are future thinking. Our app brings people together to share the cost of their travel requirements and adventures, and in the process, helps reduce their environmental footprint.</p>
            <p>Let myCarPal reimagine the way you travel.</p>

            <p style="color:#111;font-size:12px;">S, A & Z, K 2020, How to Make a Rideshare App and Is It Worth Doing?, rubygarage.org, viewed 16 April 2021,,<a href="https://rubygarage.org/blog/how-to-make-a-rideshare-app" target="_blank">https://rubygarage.org/blog/how-to-make-a-rideshare-app</a></p>
             
            <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

            <p>We want the myCarPal app to help people and the environment. To allow anyone to have the opportunity to organise regular stress-free, low fare commutes. Making things less complicated and allowing travellers to go further than metro areas. Putting traveller's minds at ease with safety and security at the heart of its design while reducing the carbon footprint created by too many cars on the roads. It's a win-win for everyone. </p>

            <p>But why choose myCarPal when there are so many other ride-sharing apps already on the market? We believe Uber and Lyft could be considered more of a replacement for taxi services and are based around profit and price-fixing. Owning your own car can be expensive to run and maintain, not to mention the vehicle's original purchase price. Maybe you do not even need the use of a car more than once or twice a year. Maybe you have accessibility requirements or you just don't like travelling alone. Additionally, public transport can be costly and not easy to use with its constantly changing and confusing timetables, and safety is always a problem. To top it off, public transport does not always go in the most straightforward route you are after.</p>

            <p>We see many reasons why customers would choose our app over others and ultimately our app is designed to make a difference in what can be one of the most stressful parts of people's lives. We like to think of it this way, life long friendships are forged through shared experiences, by choosing myCarPal, strangers share a journey and become car pals for life.</p>
            
            <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
         
            <p>When the user first downloads the myCarPal app, they must register their name, phone number, email, license details and payment details. These will then be verified. You can then choose your username.</p>

            <p>The users privacy will be prioritised, they will only need to share the relevant information with other users, e.g., <em>Blue Nissan - clean</em>" all other information will be kept private.</p>

            <p>Once they have been verified, the user can scroll through local boards, looking for users travelling in the same direction. They will be able to filter to add their destination, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney.</p>

            <p>Users can also make a post and flag the date and time they are travelling, for example, <em>A trip to Sydney from Melbourne on Monday the 5/4 leaving at 9 am and looking for two passengers.</em></p>

            <p>Users post their trip and can wait for other people to reply. When they answer, the original user who posted can accept the share and arrange a pick-up point. If they are a user looking for the same date and destination, they will receive a notification.</p>

            <p><em>Hi user Benny82 is looking to travel from Sydney to Melbourne on 5/4, leaving at 9 am in your local area. Would you like to accept the ride</em>?</p>

            <p>Once the price has been successfully negotiated the app will take a flat .99c fee transaction from both users, this will be the only charge in an effort to keep costs low for the user and make the app more competitive within the rideshare industry.</p>

            <p>The app also includes a hitchhiker function, that can use people's geolocation to send notifications to people in the area.</p>

            <p>For example, a person can be driving from Melbourne to Sydney and receive a notification <em>Thumbs up going my way?</em></p>

            <p>If the driver opens the notification, they'll see the information from the person looking to hitchhike<em>user Benny82 is hitchhiking to Canberra. They are looking for a ride he's willing to compensate $25.</em></p>

            <p>During the ride, the app shows the driver's destination. If anyone feels unsafe at any time, there is an emergency button, which they can press to report safety issues or abuse against the other users and even put them through to emergency services. Although we want people to have happy, safe trips, we feel it is essential to have an emergency feature. Once the ride has finished, the transaction will occur, and both driver and passenger go in separate directions. If it is a regular commute ride, both users can choose to set up a regular commute trip in the app.</p>

            <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
            <p>The technical requirements for the application do not seem to be so complicated and it could vary by the design of the app. Ideally, the myCarPal application will be built as a mobile app because the user should be able to use it whenever or wherever they need to. Furthermore, mobile apps could use GPS to better obtain the geolocation data of the user that is necessary for operating the application. Nevertheless, web pages would still be very useful to introduce the application and to support customer services. </p>
            <p>
                When the app is designed to be a mobile app, it should be able to run by both android and iOS operating system. It could either be done by creating separate apps for each platform or to use a development software to build an app that can run by both operation systems. Android app could be developed by using popular Android IDEs such as Android Studio and Gradle in Kotlin or Java language. iOS software could use XCode and Apple Developer Tools by primarily using Swift or C language.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, there are many software developments kit that can produce an app that is compatible with both android and iOS. Flutter could be a good option to choose because it enables a cross-platform app development to add/remove features and test them with reduced development time. </p>
            </p>
             <h3 id="tech">Tech Skills</h3>

           <p>The technical skills needed to develop the app are:</p>
<p><strong>Java for Android native apps</strong></p>
<p>Java is our first choice for the programming language we will use for the myCarPal app as it is one of the most popular and in demand programming languages in the world and one of the two official programming languages used in the development of Android Apps- Kotlin being the other one.</p>
<p>We will use Java alongside the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). Eclipse IDE primary use is for developing Java applications and we will be using the Eclipse software development kit, a free and open-source software to further develop the application.</p>
<p>Google also provides the Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugin for the standard Eclipse IDE to support graphical layout definition and debugging. (Technology, 2015)</p>
<p><strong>Objective-C (Swift) for iOS native products</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons why Obj-C has retained such a solid foothold in the sphere of iOS development, but the strong features and characteristics of the language are certainly the main selling points. It is used worldwide and over decades has earned Obj-C a solid place among the world&rsquo;s leading programming languages. Furthermore, the extensive development that it has experienced over time has made it experienced, stable, and reliable. (Ace, 2019)</p>
<p><strong>HTML (CSS, JavaScript) for cross-platform mobile apps</strong></p>
<p>It seems ideal to create a product website based on HTML language as well as styling them with CSS codes. Some additional user interface design could be effective when advertising the myCarPal app by using JavaScript or AngularJS framework to better design the website front-end. HTML and CSS does not require a significant level of expertise; however, an obvious challenge will be the display aspect ratio when we view the website on mobile device.</p>
<p>JavaScript language may cause a certain complexity when learning and developing because it requires the basic understanding of high-level programming, different to how HTML and CSS code works. Nevertheless, the outcomes of using JavaScript and AngularJS framework would be very impressive with regards to the website layout.</p>
 <h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
          <p>The outcome will result in a user-friendly ride-sharing app helping customers travel more efficiently that runs on both android and iOS operating systems. That lets users choose the way they want to travel and the direction they want to go, with a competitive flat fee cost structure that puts more profit into the user's wallet and the added benefit of saving money. An app that prioritises its users' safety and security, respecting its user's data privacy, giving people peace of mind every step of the way. Travellers be able to interact with their local community in a way that public transport does not allow. And most importantly, they'll be able to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>

          <p>Users will have security and peace of mind at their fingertips and a guarantee that all of their travel needs are being met. No more fights about who is driving, where they are going, what time will they get there? All of these questions are sorted out before users go anywhere. Their upfront costs for travelling are already sorted.</p>

<p>Reimagine ride-sharing, Imagine myCarPal.</p>
